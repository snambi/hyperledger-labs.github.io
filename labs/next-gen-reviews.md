# Lab Name
_Next Gen Reviews_

# Short Description
_Blockchain to simplify and improve employee review system used in many companies._

# Scope of Lab

_This project aims to use and improve hyperledger projects such as ursa, indy, aries._

_Most projects aim to use blockchain across organizations, while next-gen reviews are trying to use blockchain within an organization. Large organizations ( 500+ employees) suffer from many of the problems that can be effectively solved by blockchain. However, the challenges are different for running in-house blockchain, that attempts minimizes friction and dispute management using consensus. Also consensus mechanisms are well-suited for peer-to-peer networks where everynode is an equal participant. For example, how to map peer-to-peer consensus to a hierarchical organization or how do you maintain identity in an hierarchical organization._

_We believe that developing an in-house blockchain using hyperledger components will inherently benefit and improve the components._
